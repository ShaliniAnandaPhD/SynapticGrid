# SynapticGrid: AI for Smarter, More Sustainable Cities  

**SynapticGrid** is an evolving system designed to make cities **more efficient, sustainable, and livable** using AI and data-driven insights. This project focuses on **smart energy grids, waste management, and traffic optimization**—helping cities **reduce waste, ease congestion, and manage power more effectively**.  

By combining **IoT sensors, real-time data processing, and reinforcement learning**, SynapticGrid continuously learns and improves, adapting to the needs of growing urban environments. This isn't just a research project—it’s a practical system designed to help cities operate smarter.

- Helps cities manage **renewable energy sources** efficiently  
- Predicts energy needs in real-time to **optimize distribution**  
- Reduces energy waste and improves reliability with **adaptive learning models**  

### 2. **Intelligent Waste Management**  
- **Smart bins** monitor waste levels and send alerts when they need to be emptied  
- AI sorts waste **more accurately over time**, improving recycling rates  
- Optimized collection routes **reduce fuel consumption** and traffic  
- Data-driven recommendations help **place bins where they’re needed most**  

### 3. **Traffic Optimization & Smart Mobility**  
- AI adjusts **traffic light timing** to reduce congestion in real time  
- **Predicts traffic patterns** to help with long-term urban planning  
- Optimizes **public transport and electric vehicle routes** for efficiency  
- Monitors **pedestrian movement and vehicle flow** to improve road safety
